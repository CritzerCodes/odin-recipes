        <h2><strong>Beware!</strong> Plankton is looking for some idiot who left their patties out.</h2>
        <P>Make your very own Krabby Patties from Spongebob. You will need adult supervision to make this meal unless you are a <em>neglected </em> child who raised themself. All items can be found at your local grocery store. Plus, the aioli sauce sounds to die for. </P>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Burger</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Sea salt</li>
            <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>King Neptune's Poseidon Powder Aioli</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 c. mayyonnaise</li> 
            <li>1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sandwich</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 sesame seed buns, sliced in half</li>
            <li>ketchup and mustard</li>
            <li>Dill Pickles</li>
            <li>Red Onion, Tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 leaves of butter lettuce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the Burger Patties:</strong> Heat a grill pan or sauté pan over medium heat. As it heats, combine ground beef, Old Bay, pepper and salt. Form into four equally sized patties, about 1/3 lb apiece. Set on a platter next to the stovetop. Coat the warmed grill pan with cooking spray and place patties on the pan, cooking each side about 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through to your desired doneness.</li>

            <li>Use a large star-shaped cookie cutter to cut each cheese slice into a star shape. Place the star-shaped cheese on each burger patty, in the last 30 seconds or so of cooking, so it melts a little. Set burger patties aside.</li>

            <li><strong>Make King Neptune’s Poseidon Powder Aioli: </strong>Stir mayo and Old Bay until thoroughly combined. </li>

            <li><strong>Assemble the Sandwich:</strong> Spread Poseidon Powder Aioli on the bottom of each bun. Top with a burger patty, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onion slices, tomato and lettuce. Place the top bun on each burger. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
